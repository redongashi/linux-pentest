# linux-pentest
A list of tools and configurations to create a good-looking and fully equipped penetration testing environment.

Feel free to copy, but be careful to change variables and other dynamic stuff in configuration files in order not to break things as this was made for my specific environment.

This project is developed and tested on:

| Software | Version |
| ------ | ------ |
| Kali Linux 64-bit | 2020.2 |
| Kernel | Kernel 5.6.0-kali2-amd64 |
| KDE Plasma Version | 5.17.5 |
| KDE Frameworks Version | 5.62 |
| Qt Version | 5.12 |

This is not yet complete due to not having enough time to commit.
